# Telco-Churn-Analysis
Business intelligence project on telecom churn using Power BI, Power Query, and Excel

## Introduction

This project focuses on a critical challenge in the telecommunications industry: customer churn. High churn rates directly impact revenue, growth, and market share. 

## Goals

The goals of this project are to:

•	Significantly reduce the customer churn rate across the customer base.

•	Minimize the financial losses associated with customer attrition.

•	Enhance customer longevity and secure long-term revenue streams.

## Objectives
Leveraging advanced data analysis and visualization techniques, the objective was to understand the underlying drivers of customer attrition.

To achieve the stated goals, the following specific objectives were established:

•	Identify and quantify churn rates across various customer dimensions.

•	Pinpoint the revenue impact associated with churn.

•	Uncover specific operational or service related factors contributing to churn.
 
•	Identify vulnerable segments and develop actionable insights and strategic recommendations to improve customer retention.

This analysis aims to empower stakeholders with data-driven intelligence to improve customer longevity and secure revenue.

## Tools Used 

#### Power BI Desktop 
Utilized for comprehensive data modeling, transformation, complex DAX calculations, and the creation of an interactive, insightful dashboard.

#### DAX 
Employed for creating sophisticated measures and calculated columns to derive specific KPIs and metrics.

#### Microsoft Excel
Used for initial data cleaning, preparation.

#### Data Analysis & Visualization 

## Key Insights Derived

Through the analysis of customer data, several critical insights were uncovered;

#### Overall Churn Impact: 
The business is experiencing a significant loss, with 1,869 customers churning out of 7,043, leading to a substantial 26.54% churn rate and a financial hit of 2.86 Million in lost cumulative revenue. This highlights the urgent need for intervention to reduce these losses.

#### Contract Type Dominates Churn
A compelling 88.55% of all churn originates from monthly subscribers. This insight is critical as it indicates that customers on short-term commitments are the highest-risk group, possibly due to less loyalty or easier cancellation.

#### Service Type 
Customers using Fiber Optic internet services exhibit the highest churn rate at 42%. The analytical dashboard suggests this is most likely due to its cost as it is the most expensive internet service, pointing towards potential pricing issues or a dissapointmenr in service provision when weighed againt what it charges.


#### Tenure by churn pattern
Customer churn varies significantly by how long they've been with the company:

• Short-term customers (equal to or below 12 months tenure) are highly volatile, showing the highest churn risk at 47.44%. This indicates a critical period for engagement and value demonstration early in the customer lifecycle.

• Medium-term customers (equal to or below 24 months tenure) have a notable churn rate of 28.71%.

• Long-term customers ( above 24 months tenure) show the lowest churn rate at 14.04%, suggesting higher loyalty or satisfaction over time.
  
#### Revenue at Risk
Long term customers generate 89% of the total revenue ($14.3M). This insight is crucial: while short-term customers churn more frequently, the loss of a long-term customer has a much higher financial impact, underscoring the vital importance of retaining this high-value segment.

#### Age Related Churn Patterns
The analysis reveals distinct patterns based on age groups:

• Aged customers ( older demographics) churn significantly more frequently at 42%.
   
• Younger customers (Not Aged) customers have a lower churn rate (24%), their higher number means that churn from this group still results in more overall revenue loss. This points to different underlying reasons for churn across age groups.
   
#### Payment Method Influence
Customers using Electronic Check as their payment method contribute the highest churn count. This suggests potential  dissatisfaction linked to this specific payment option that needs further investigation.

#### Customer Valuation & Churn
The Customer Valuation segment pinpoints a high value customer churns (a customer valued at about 8.6K). This demonstrates that attrition is not isolated to low value customers, even the most valued clients churn too. There is a need for retention strategies that consider all customer segments and identify high value customers at risk.


## Recommendations

Based on the insights, the following actionable recommendations are proposed:

#### Strategic Contract Incentives
Implement targeted loyalty programs and incentives ( discounts,bundled services) to encourage monthly subscribers to commit to longer-term contracts, thereby reducing churn from this high-risk segment.

#### Fiber Optic Value Re-evaluation
Conduct a review of Fiber Optic pricing and service offerings. Consider bundling value-added services,enhancing customer support for these users, or offering tiered pricing to mitigate cost driven churn.

#### Enhanced Onboarding for Short Term Customers
Develop a robust onboarding and early engagement program for new customers, ensuring they experience immediate value and understand service benefits to reduce early churn.

#### Prioritize Long Term Customer Loyalty
Given their high revenue contribution, establish exclusive loyalty programs, personalized communication channels, and proactive service checks for long term customers to ensure their continued satisfaction and retention.

#### Age Segment Strategies
Design specific retention campaigns for older customers focusing on simplified support, accessible communication, and plans that meet their specific needs. For younger customers, address their churn drivers through targeted offers, service improvements and improved customer service. 

#### Investigate Electronic Check Issues
Conduct user experience research or surveys specifically for customers using Electronic Check to identify any pain points or dissatisfaction. Promote alternatives probably the most used and more seamless payment methods.

#### Proactive High Value Customer Retention
Identify high value customers at risk of churning using predictive models and deploy a specialized retention team with personalized offers and improved customer service to prevent their attrition.


## Future Works and Future recommendation

To further enhance this churn analysis and drive more impactful business outcomes, these steps are highly recommended:

#### Predictive Churn Modeling
Implementing a machine learning model to forecast individual customer churn likelihood, enabling the business to  intervene before a customer churns.

#### Granular Customer Segmentation
Explore advanced segmentation techniques (e.g., behavioral segmentation, RFM analysis) to identify more nuanced and high risk customer groups and tailor retention strategies with greater precision.

#### Root Cause Analysis
Integrate qualitative data from customer feedback, support tickets, and exit surveys to uncover the "why" behind churn from the customer's perspective.

#### A/B Testing of Strategies
Design and execute A/B tests for various proposed retention initiatives and strategies to scientifically measure their effectiveness and optimize resource allocation.
